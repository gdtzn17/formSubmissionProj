This project will not be edited by anyone else. 
This project is designed to utilize my web dev skills on actual work instead of being stuck in tutorial hell.

Created HTML document and layout w/ CSS stylesheet.

Adjusted and fixed input classes. Having issue with name and last name ghost value. Specifically, this is about color: distinguishing the difference between a prompt and actual user input values.
